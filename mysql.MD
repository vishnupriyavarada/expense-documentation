# MySQL

Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

**Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer.**

Install MySQL Server 8.0.x

```
dnf install mysql-server -y
```

Start MySQL Service

```
systemctl enable mysqld
```
```
systemctl start mysqld
```

Generally we use below 3 commands to check the health of DB server       

        To check the status of mysqld. to check all database is up and running and active or not.

        ```
        systemctl status mysqld
        ```

        another command to check the status

        ```
        ps -ef | grep mysql
        ```
        To check port is opened or not 
        ```
        netstat -nltp
        ```


Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password ExpenseApp@1 or any other as per your choice.

```
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass ExpenseApp@1
```

## Verification

We can check data by using client package called mysql.

Usually command to connect mysql server is

```
mysql -h <host-address> -u root -p<password>
```

But if your client and server both are in a single server, you can simply issue.

```
mysql
```

Once you got mysql prompt, you can use below command to check schemas/databases exist.

```
show databases;
```

Once you are in particular schema, you can get the list of tables.

```
show tables;
```

You can get entries of a table using

```
select * from <table_name>;
```
